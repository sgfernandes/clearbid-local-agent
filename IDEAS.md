# Ideas

- **Dynamic mounts:** Allow mounting host folders without restarting the VM.
- **Network proxy:** Route agent traffic through a proxy for visibility and prompt injection protection.
- **Artifacts:** Let the agent create artifacts that can be easily downloaded by the client.
- **Desktop control via VNC:** Use macOS Screen Sharing to let the agent control the full desktop, not just the browser. Requires enabling Screen Sharing on the host. ⚠️ Dangerous - gives agent full system access.
